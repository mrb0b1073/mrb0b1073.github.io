## 👨‍💻 whoami

Hey! I’m just a curious mind who loves digging into cybersecurity and ethical hacking. I enjoy tinkering with systems, breaking things (in a good way), and then figuring out how to put them back together. Most of the time you’ll find me messing around with pentesting tools, chasing flags, or exploring cryptography puzzles just for fun.

## What is this❓​
This blog is basically my thoughts on several hacking topics. Here you’ll see:

 - Writeups from CTF challenges, from platforms like HackTheBox or OverTheWire.

 - Walkthroughs and notes on pentesting techniques I’m learning or testing.

 - Some posts on cryptography — because math can be fun (sometimes).
 
 - Random topics that freaks like me may (just may) find interesting.

The idea is simple: share what I learn, document my journey, and maybe help others who are also diving into the exciting world of ethical hacking.
