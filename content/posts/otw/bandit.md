## Introduction
In this post series we are going to solve every level from bandit in [*OverTheWire*](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/).
This guide pretends to be a writeup containing the solutions of the level, designed for beginners. 

To play the games, you just need a Linux OS or terminal, some patience and motivation for learning. If you are windows user I recommend installing [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install), it's really simple to use. But of course you could use Kali Linux, Parrot, or basically any Linux system.

Every section will contain the solution as well as some tips for people who is absolutely beginner.

## Tips
First of all, some tips:
 - **Do not** use this as first resource to solve the levels. Try on your own, make mistakes and learn from them. Only check the solution as last resource or if you are completely new and you have absolutely no idea about what to do next. 
 - Take notes from your learning. Write up commands, tips and everything which can be useful in the future.
 - Make sure to understand everything.
 - Is a good idea to note the passwords for every level. If you want to continue letter, you can simply log in in the desired level. It is annoying to repeat everything!
 - Follow the tips and information provided at OverTheWire website.
