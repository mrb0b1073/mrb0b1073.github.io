This is intended to be a short, practical roadmap to get started in ethical hacking — what hackers do, the mindset behind it, the technical foundations you should build, and the platforms and some tools/personal recommendations that will actually teach you. We could call this a beginner starting point for ethical hacking from my point of view.\nIn cybersecurity there are broadly two complementary roles: Blue Team and Red Team. Blue Teams focus on defense, monitoring, incident response, hardening systems and keeping services secure, while Red Teams simulate attackers to find weaknesses and prove what an adversary could do. Ethical hacking aligns closely with Red Team operations, but cybersecurity is highly transversal across IT. There are many specialities or areas, such as cloud security, appsec, pentesting, forensics, governance, risk management, malware analysis, etc. Every topic could deserve its own post, so let’s keep it simple and focus on ethical hacking.\nHacker philosophy Let’s start with the idea of what is exactly a hacker. A hacker is someone who explores systems to understand how they work, finds creative ways to make or fix things, and solves technical problems. Historically the word describes curiosity, craft, and a drive to improve systems — not criminality. It is important to make the distinction between hacker and cracker, also called cybercriminal. A hacker explores, builds, discloses responsibly and works to improve security. They work in authorized environments or labs. On the other hand, a cracker breaks into systems for theft, vandalism or other illicit gain.\nHere you can find the most popularized ideas often summarized as the hacker ethic:\nCuriosity first: Learn by exploring and tinkering. Freedom of information: All knowledge should be shared to help progress. This fits properly with the idea of open source. Mistrust of needless authority: Centralized control sometimes blocks innovation. It is always good to question anything, specially common assumptions. Meritocracy: Skills, craft and results matter more than titles. Craftsmanship \u0026 elegance: Technical beauty matters. Build clean, clever and efficient solutions. Responsability \u0026 ethics: Use your skills to build, fix, educate and defend, not to harm. Core fundamentals Assuming you want to init yourself in hacking, you should first build competence across three basic pillars.\nOperating Systems You should learn as much as possible about Linux and Windows. Specially Linux, all the tools you will be using are meant to be used in a Linux environment. Skill with shell is required, learn basic commands and how to interact with the OS using the terminal. Research about processes, file permissions, package management and logs. A large proportion of web servers around the world run on Linux, although Windows is also widely used. Windows knowledge is really valuable too, considering active directory is strongly used in corporate environments.\nNetworking You have to understand how computers communicate each other. Understand basic networking concepts, IP adresses, subnetting, proxies, find out how internet works. Study some protocols such as TCP/IP, HTTP, DNS or SSH. This could sound confusing for beginners, but this step is not optional! Study different client/server models and how services expose attack surfaces.\nProgramming \u0026 scripting Is this completely required? Maybe not for complete beginners. Does it help? Absolutely yes. Understanding how web apps or any type of application works makes things much easier. You can imagine different entry points to exploit if you understand how systems are designed. Also writing scripts in bash or python makes you more productive through automation.\nEthical Hacking foundations Once you feel confident with these 3 pillars, you can go to the next step. You can study about different topics and areas. For example, binary exploiting, web pentesting, mobile pentesting, wireless hacking, etc. You should start picking a focus, in this post we focus on web pentesting, as it is beginner friendly. Also web applications are the bread and butter in companies nowadays.\nKey concepts to study:\nCIA Triad: CIA refers to Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability. These three concepts are key in information security, and describe properties we want to ensure in our systems and information. Web Security basics, OWASP: Study the OWASP Top 10, which summarizes most frequent web security risks. Authentication and session control: Understand the concepts of Authentication and Authorization, research about how session is handled in web apps, cookies, JWT tokens, etc. Input validation \u0026 injection attacks: Learn about SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Code Injection, SSTI, and every injection type. Secure development lifecycle: Find out how to implement security controls in code. This can be more related to Blue Team, but as Red Teamer it is important to understand. Firewall evasion: What a firewall is and some techniques/methods to bypass. Some cryptography: Understand what a chiper and a hash are, how information is encrypted to prevent access from 3rd parties. Focusing on web, read about TLS protocol. There are many more topics you can research and learn, but this could be a nice starting point.\nTools and platforms to learn Now you have an idea of what to study, let’s see how to start in practical terms.\nSome platforms I personally recommend:\nOverTheWire: Here you can find some CTFs (Capture The Flag) which are fun to play and also really instructive. Bandit games are a must for complete beginners, as you will explore some linux and bash concepts which are basic to continue. The games are leveled by difficulty, in their web you can get all the information about how to play, only a terminal and SSH is required. This helps building your foundation in Linux OS. HackTheBox: Nº 1 platform in cybersecurity. Has a lot of resources to learn all this core fundamentals, and also red team / blue team security topics. It is focused on labs where you can test your skills hacking different boxes but if you really want to learn it is worth to invest time and money in the academy. I have to say the level here is high, specially if you try to hack machines on your own without using some guide or writeup. TryHackMe: More beginner friendly than hackthebox, it provides a lot of guided learning resources. PortSwigger Labs: Practical labs about specific topics, focused on web hacking. They are great to learn and understand different types of attacks, injections, and security misconfigurations. I would recommend digging into this once you have the theoretical basis about these concepts. I have to mention a few tools I am sure you’d end up using:\nNmap: This is probably the most famous tool in hacking, allowing you to gather information about ports and services running in a machine. Burpsuite: A proxy tool widely used in web application security testing. It basically allows you to intercept and modify web requests, which can be used to perform several types of attacks. Metasploit: The most used pentesting framework. Contains a large amount of scripts and exploits ready to run. Another crucial step here is to set up your virtual lab environment to test vulnerable applications. To achieve this goal, there are some Linux distributions like Kali, Parrot or BlackArch, but that’s a topic for another post.\nFinal thoughs To sum up, this would be my personal roadmap:\nLearn the fundamentals, specially Linux and networking. Install some Linux in a virtual machine, play with it, get comfortable with the terminal. You can start with bandit wargames in OverTheWire. Complete every level and make sure to understand everything as clear as possible. Move to guided boxes on HackTheBox. I recommend you joining their Discord, ask questions, community is great there! Take notes, repeat, learn, improve your skills. Maybe use your own lab environment, create your own vulnerable apps. Hacking is a mixing of curiosity, study and practice. Being passionate and motivated about it is really helpful and will definitely speed up the process. The path is long and really challenging, so keep it going!\n“Yes, I am a criminal.
