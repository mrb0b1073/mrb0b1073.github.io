I’m just a curious mind who loves digging into cybersecurity and ethical hacking. I enjoy tinkering with systems, breaking things (in a good way), and then figuring out how to put them back together. Most of the time you’ll find me messing around with pentesting tools, chasing flags, or exploring cryptography puzzles just for fun.\nWhat is this❓​ This blog is basically my thoughts on several hacking topics. Here you’ll see:\nWriteups from CTF challenges, from platforms like HackTheBox or OverTheWire.\nWalkthroughs and notes on pentesting techniques I’m learning or testing.\nSome posts on cryptography — because math can be fun (sometimes).\nRandom topics that freaks like me may (just may) find interesting.\nThe idea is simple: share what I learn, document my journey, and maybe help others who are also diving into the exciting world of ethical hacking.\n📫 Contact Want to say hi, share ideas, or just geek out about hacking?
